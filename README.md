# Ubercart Extension

[Checkout.com](https://www.checkout.com "Checkout.com") is a software platform that has integrated 100% of the value chain to create payment infrastructures that truly make a difference.

This extension allows shop owners to process online payments (card / alternative payments) using:
  - **Frames.js** - Payment form embedded within your website
  - **Checkout.js** - Customisable payment widget 
  - **Checkout.js Hosted** - Redirection to a customisable page on Checkout.com's servers
  - **Alternative payments** - Shoppers can pay using local payment options (Sofort, iDEAL, Boleto ... etc.)

# Installation
You can find a full installation guide [here](https://github.com/checkout/checkout-ubercart-module/wiki/Installation)

# Initial Setup
If you do not have an account yet, simply go to [checkout.com](https://checkout.com/) and hit the "Get Test Account" button.

# Keys
There are 3 keys that you need to configure:
- **Secret Key**
- **Public Key**
- **Private Shared Key**

> The Private Shared Key is generated when you [configure the Webhook URL](https://docs.checkout.com/docs/business-level-administration#section-manage-webhook-url) in the Checkout HUB.

# URLs
In order to successfully complete 3D Secure transactions, and to keep Ubercart order statuses in sync you need to configure the following URLs in your Checkout HUB as follows:

| Type | URL Example | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Redirections **Success**| _example.com_**/checkoutpayment/success** | Redirect after 3D Secure |
| Redirections **Fail**| _example.com_**example.com/checkoutpayment/fail** | Redirect after 3D Secure |
| Webhook | _example.com_**/checkoutpayment/webhook** | Sync Ubercart |

> You can see a guide on how to set the URLs in the HUB [here](https://docs.checkout.com/docs/business-level-administration#section-manage-channel-urls) ; You can find test card details [here](https://docs.checkout.com/docs/testing#section-credit-cards)

# Going LIVE

Upon receiving your live credentials from your account manager, here are the required steps to start processing live transactions:

- In the plugin settings, place your **live** keys
- Switch the _Endpoint URL mode_ to **live**.
- Make sure you have configured the Redirection and Webhook URLs correctly in your **live** Checkout.com HUB
